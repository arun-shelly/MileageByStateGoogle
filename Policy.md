## 📌 Mileage Calculation Policy Statement

Beginning immediately, **all mileage and state‑based reimbursement calculations** are derived from the **Google Directions API** using the official road route between the recorded start and end GPS coordinates.

This replaces the current one where we are paying as per home state

***

## 📌 Rationale

1.  **Accuracy**  
    Google Maps provides drivable routes, not geometric shortcuts.  
    This yields realistic mileage and state traversal data.

2.  **Transparency**  
    All employees can independently verify mileage using Google Maps.

3.  **Consistency**  
    Google’s routing algorithms offer consistent, industry‑standard results.

4.  **Compliance**  
    High‑pay states are only applied when truly entered via Google route.

***

## 📌 Impacts

*   Mileage totals may increase or decrease slightly from the old system.
*   Disputes will be resolved by reviewing the same Google Maps route used by the system.

***

## 📌 Exception Process

If the employee believes Google Routes is incorrect:

*   They may submit a mileage review request
*   The auditing team will compare alternative Google route options
*   Manual adjustments may be made only if Google clearly misroutes (rare)

## 📌 Employee Communication Summary

> Mileage is calculated using Google Maps’ recommended driving route.  
> Your reimbursements reflect the distance and states that Google Maps shows  
> when traveling between your recorded start and end locations.

***

## 📌 Compliance Notes

*   Deduction rules remain unchanged
*   High‑pay states are only applied when Google’s route physically enters those states
